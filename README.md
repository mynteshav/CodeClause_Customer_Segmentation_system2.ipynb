# Customer Segmentation System

This project is a **Customer Segmentation System** built using unsupervised learning techniques to identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behaviors. The goal is to help businesses understand customer segments and tailor marketing strategies effectively.

This project was developed as part of my Data Science Internship at **CodeClause**.

## 📌 Project Objective

To perform customer segmentation using clustering algorithms (K-Means) on shopping behavior data. This enables companies to categorize customers into distinct groups for personalized marketing and improved business strategies.

## 📊 Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding customer behavior
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method
- Clustering using **K-Means algorithm**
- Customer segmentation visualization using PCA
- Clear insights and recommendations for business decision-making

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains information about customer annual income, spending score, and other personal attributes. It is a common dataset used for unsupervised learning experiments.

| Column Name      | Description                     |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| CustomerID       | Unique ID for each customer     |
| Gender           | Gender of the customer          |
| Age              | Age of the customer             |
| Annual Income    | Customer's annual income        |
| Spending Score   | Score assigned based on spending behavior |
